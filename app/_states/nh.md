## Voter ID

You will be requested to show photo ID to vote in New Hampshire.

Voters without ID: If you do not have a valid photo ID, you can either have your identity verified by a voting official at your voting location, or be photographed by a voting official at your voting location before you vote (if you object to being photographed for religious reasons, you can sign a sworn statement instead).
