## Voter ID

You will be requested to show photo ID to vote in New Hampshire. Acceptable forms include (the name on the ID must be substantially similar to the voter registration record and the expiration date cannot exceed five years): a driver's license from any state; a non-driver ID issued by the motor vehicle agency of any state; a US armed services ID card; some NH student ID cards; or a US passport.

Voters without ID: If you do not have a valid photo ID, you can either have your identity verified by a voting official at your voting location, or be photographed by a voting official at your voting location before you vote (if you object to being photographed for religious reasons, you can sign a sworn statement instead).
